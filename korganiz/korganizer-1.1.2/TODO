* make the alarm dialog box better, add snooze support

* more sophisticated category handling/management/filtering

* cut/paste in popups in kagenda

* make holiday stuff coincide/work with locale stuff (instead of being
  manually set up)

* be able to go to a date directly (i.e. type in the date, instead of using
  the date navigator)

* syncronization between two calendars

* keep a log of past activities (an alternative to purge/archive?  Or
  maybe just be able to present this in a nice format?)

* More consistency between Todo's and appointments.

* color different priority items in different shades / colors

* New todo on actions popup

* set priorities for all items

* extend searching for existing appointments, free time, etc.

* some sort of basic drop support with option to make new calendar /
	insert entries in the dropped calendar.

* don't make events which "overlap" each other timewise sit on top of each
	other in agenda view.  Divide the space in half (hard...)

* REMOVE ALL BUGS! (HAH)
