<H3><A NAME="s4">4. Main Program Window</A></H3>

<P>When KOrganizer starts, you are first presented with the main
KOrganizer window.  The window has several components, including a
menubar, a toolbar, a month calendar, a current ``view'' of events,
and a tasklist.  The calendar defaults to displaying today's date.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 Menus</A>
</H3>

<P>The menus provide access to all the common operations that can be
performed on the calendar, including saving, loading, adding and
deleting appointments, printing, etc. etc.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="sec-file"></A> File Menu</H4>

<P>The <CODE>File</CODE> menu provides access to functions involving the
entire calendar.
<P>
<P>
<DL>
<P>
<DT><B>New Window</B><DD><P>Allows you to open up another main window.  You might
want to do this if you wish to have two simultaneous but different
views of a calendar open at once.
<P>
<DT><B>Open</B><DD><P>Opens a file dialog allowing you to select a new vCalendar
to load.  If you have made changes to the current calendar, you will
be given the option of saving them before loading a new one.
<P>
<DT><B>Open Recent</B><DD><P>Provides a list of recently opened calendars for
quick access, allowing you to bypass the file dialog entirely.
<P>
<DT><B>Close</B><DD><P>Closes the current window. If this is the last window, this
choice has the same effect as Quit.
<P>
<DT><B>Save</B><DD><P>Saves the calendar to disk, making sure all changes you
might have made will be kept.  If the calendar has no name, save will
behave like <CODE>Save As</CODE>.
<P>
<DT><B>Save As</B><DD><P>Gives you a file dialog so that you may choose a
different name for your calendar than the one currently assigned to
it.  Useful if you have made changes to a calendar that you want to
save, but also want to keep separate from your ``regular'' calendar.
<P>
<DT><B>Import From Ical</B><DD><P>If you have used ical, a popular but older
calendar program for unix using the Tk widget set, you may wish to
import your appointments, events, and todo items directly to
KOrganizer.  This action will read the <CODE>.calendar</CODE> file from
your home directory and merge any entries it contains into your
current calendar.  If any errors or suspicious things occur during the
process, you will be notified via a message box.
<P>
<DT><B>Merge Calendar</B><DD><P>If you have a different vCalendar file somewhere,
and you would like to include its contents into your own calendar,
this will do just that.  A good time to do this would be if you
received a vCalendar with a few entries via e-mail, for instance.
<P>
<DT><B>Print Setup</B><DD><P>Brings up the print setup dialog and allows you to
set up how you want printed output to appear.  See 
<A HREF="korganizer-7.html#sec-print">the section on printing</A> for more information.
<P>
<DT><B>Print</B><DD><P>Prints the current calendar.
<P>
<DT><B>Print Preview</B><DD><P>Prints the current calendar and displays it with
your print preview program, instead of sending the output  directly to
the printer.  You can choose the program that you use to preview
output in the 
<A HREF="korganizer-7.html#sec-optionsdlg">Options dialog</A>.
<P>
<DT><B>Quit</B><DD><P>Quits KOrganizer, prompting to save if the current calendar
has been modified but not yet saved.
<P>
</DL>
<P>
<H4><A NAME="sec-edit"></A> Edit Menu</H4>

<P>The <CODE>Edit</CODE> menu provides editing operations on appointments.
<P>
<P>
<DL>
<P>
<DT><B>Cut</B><DD><P>Cuts the currently selected appointment(s) to the clipboard,
removing them from your calendar.
<P>
<DT><B>Copy</B><DD><P>Copies the currently selected appointment(s) to the
clipboard, leaving them untouched in your calendar.
<P>
<DT><B>Paste</B><DD><P>Inserts the contents of the clipboard into your calendar.
The clipboard must contain a valid vCalendar, provided either by a
previous Cut/Copy operation or from a selection made outside of
KOrganizer.  You will be warned if the contents of the clipboard
cannot be understood.

<P>
<H3><A NAME="sec-datenav"></A> <A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 Date Navigator</A>
</H3>

<P>
<IMG SRC="datenavigator.gif">
<P>The small calendar that is in the upper-left corner of the screen
is the main way provided to navigate among and select from various
dates.  The single-arrow icons move forwards and backwards in time by
increments of a month, while the double-arrows allow moving by years
at a time.  Today's date will be outlined with a gray box.  Dates
which have appointments scheduled on them will be bold and a different
color than the regular dates.  Selecting a date is accomplished simply
by clicking on it; multiple dates may be selected/deselected simply by
holding down the <CODE>control</CODE> key while clicking.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3 Views</A>
</H3>

<P>There are several different ``views'' available for displaying your
list of events and appointments, including a ``list'' view, a ``day''
view, a ``week'' view, and a ``month'' view.  KOrganizer is smart
enough to remember in between sessions what the last active view was,
and the next time it is started, it will default to that view.
<P>
<P>In general, each view will provide a way of displaying your events
and appointments constrained to a particular time period or style of
display.  clicking on any appointment will select it for further
action.  Right clicking an appointment brings up a menu with options
such as <CODE>edit</CODE>, <CODE>delete</CODE>, and so on.  You can also use
the <CODE>Action</CODE> menu to perform similar operations.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="sec-listview"></A> List View</H4>

<P>This view allows you to see all your appointments for the day in
list-type arrangement.  Appointments are displayed one per line.  The
first column of the appointment will have a bell icon displayed in it
if an alarm is set for the appointment.  The second column will
display a chasing-arrows icon if the appointment repeats multiple
times.  Holding the mouse over the arrows icon will bring up a tooltip
with more detailed recurrence information.  The third column displays
start and end time information, and the fourth column gives a summary
of the appointment.
<P>
<P>The list view is good for displaying many appointments on a single
day in a compact fashion.  It is also useful if your appointments are
spread out over a long time period that would not normally fit
entirely on the screen when using one of the other views.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="sec-dayview"></A> Day View</H4>

<P>This view presents your appointment information in a chronological
fashion which also provides visual feedback on the length of each
appointment.  Time is indicated on the left side of the view.  A
scrollbar on the right is provided when the entire day cannot fit onto
the screen at one time (which is the usual case).  Each rectangle in
the view represents an individual appointment, and displays the
appointment's start and end time, summary, and whether or not the
appointment repeats or has any alarms set.
<P>
<IMG SRC="kagenda-appointment.gif">
<P>
<P>A useful shortcut that this view provides for adding appointments
is the ability to double-click on any open region of time, which will
automatically create a one hour long appointment and let you start
editing the description.  The appointment's ``snap'' to half-hour
increments, rounding off to the closest half hour from where you
clicked.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="sec-weekview"></A> Week View</H4>

<P>The week view provides a view very similar to the day view for
displaying seven days worth of appointments next to each other.  All
of the functions available for the day view are available in the week
view.  See the 
<A HREF="#sec-dayview">Day View</A> section for
further information.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="sec-monthview"></A> Month View </H4>

<P>The month view displays all the appointments for the current month
in a familar calendar layout.  Each day displays all of the appoints
that can fit in the area provided (maximizing the window will enable
you to see more appointments).  Information on repeating and alarm
status is indicated through icons.
<P>
<P>Navigation inside the month view is provided by a set of buttons
along the right side of the screen.  By pressing the appropriate
upwards-facing button, you can navigate by week, month, or even year.
The downwards-facing buttons perform the analogous function, except
forwards in time versus backwards.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="sec-todolist"></A> <A NAME="ss4.4">4.4 Todo List</A>
</H3>

<P>The todo list is unfortunately in a state of flux, so what is
described here (as far as ``operation'' of the todo list goes) may
change in the near future.
<P>
<P>The todolist provides a place for you to jot down quick (or
long-term) notes to yourself about things that you need to do.
Currently, you cannot associate a date due with a todo entry, but this
is forthcoming.  You can however assign priorities to todos, and they
will appear sorted in order of priority.  The lower the number, the
higher the priority, except that zero (0) is defined as ``no
priority.''
<P>
<P>To make a new todo entry, right click in the todo box.  You will
get a menu with the option to create a new entry.  If you clicked on
an already existing todo, you will also see a choice to delete that
entry if you wish.  When you choose <CODE>New Todo</CODE>, a new todo will
be created and you will be prompted to enter a short description.
After doing this, you can change the priority by double-clicking in
the second column of the todo, which will bring up a list of possible
priorities.  simply click on one to choose it.  Similarly, if you
double-click in the description (third) column of an existing todo,
you will be able to edit the description.  Double clicking on the box
(first column) will toggle the todo's ``completed'' status.  
<P>
<P>You may also pick <CODE>Purge Completed</CODE> from the right mouse
button menu to delete all todo entries that you have marked completed.
This is handy for quick cleanup.
<P>
<P>As has already been mentioned, the todo list could be a lot
friendlier and fancier, and we plan for it to be so.  If you have any
suggestions for what you would like to see in the todo list, please
e-mail the authors.
