<P>The options dialog will allow you to configure a number of different
areas of KOrganizer.  
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss7.1">7.1 Personal</A>
</H3>

<P>The personal options relate to your personal identity, and other
miscellaneous things that don't fall under any of the other general
categories.
<P>
<DL>
<P>
<DT><B>Your Name</B><DD><P>Refers to your full name.
<P>
<DT><B>Email Address</B><DD><P>Your email address, which will be used both to
identify appointments and events which belong to you, and for group
scheduling, so others know what address to send appointments to.
<P>
<DT><B>Additional</B><DD><P>Additional information about yourself.  Currently this
field is unused, so you may safely ignore it.
<P>
</DL>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="ss7.2">7.2 Time &amp; Date</A>
</H3>

<P>
<P>
<DL>
<P>
<DT><B>Time Zone</B><DD><P>Specifies your time zone in hours offset from UTC
(GMT).  For the US East Coast, that means -0500 when Daylight Savings
are not in effect, and -0400 when they are.  KOrganizer will
automatically adjust for daylight savings.  In the future, the name of
the region (i.e. US/Eastern) will be specified instead of the
harder-to-remember numeric representation.
<P>
<DT><B>Time Format</B><DD><P>Here, you may choose either 24 hour or 12 hour
(am/pm) time representations.  Most widgets and display areas in
KOrganizer are smart enough to switch between the two, but there are a
few remaining areas where you may notice that this property has not
been fully implemented.  This will change before the 1.0 release.
<P>
<DT><B>Default Appointment Time</B><DD><P>When you choose <CODE>New Appointment</CODE>
from the 
<A HREF="korganizer-4.html#sec-action">Action Menu</A>, or create an
appointment in some other manner such that KOrganizer cannot guess
what time you would like it to start at, KOrganizer will put this hour
in the start time editor as the default value.
<P>
<DT><B>Default Alarm Time</B><DD><P>Select the time at which you would like alarms
to go off preceeding the actual event's scheduled time.  Right now,
you must choose among the hard-coded times that are available.
<P>

<H3><A NAME="ss7.3">7.3 Fonts</A>
</H3>

<P>
<P>
<DL>
<P>
<DT><B>List View</B><DD><P>The font which appointments are displayed in for 
<A HREF="korganizer-4.html#sec-listview">List View</A>.
<P>
<DT><B>Schedule View</B><DD><P>The font which appointments are displayed in for
<A HREF="korganizer-4.html#sec-dayview">Schedule View</A>, which includes views such
as 
<A HREF="korganizer-4.html#sec-dayview">Day View</A> and 
<A HREF="korganizer-4.html#sec-weekview">Week View</A>.
<P>
<DT><B>Month View</B><DD><P>The font which appointments are displayed in for 
<A HREF="korganizer-4.html#sec-monthview">Month View</A>.
<P>
<DT><B>Time Bar</B><DD><P>Currently unimplemented.
<P>

<H3><A NAME="ss7.5">7.5 Views</A>
</H3>

<P>
<P>
<DL>
<P>
<DT><B>Day Begins At</B><DD><P>this is the hour for which KOrganizer defaults to
on the scroll bar when you are in day or week view.  Useful when you
don't usually have appointments beginning before 8 or 9 o'clock in the
morning.
<P>
</DL>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="sec-print"></A> <A NAME="ss7.6">7.6 Printing</A>
</H3>

<P>
<P>
<DL>
<P>
<DT><B>Paper Size</B><DD><P>Specifies the size of paper you want to print on by
default.  You may also choose each time you print something other than
the default.  Most likely you will choose A4 in Europe, and Letter
everywhere else.
<P>
<DT><B>Paper Orientation</B><DD><P>Specifies what direction you want prints to be
facing.  Portait is vertically, Landscape is horizontally.  Disabled at
the moment, because the various views decide on what the paper orientation
should be themselves. If this changes, the option will be enabled.
<P>
<DT><B>Preview Program</B><DD><P>Tells KOrganizer what program you want to use
when you choose <CODE>Print Preview</CODE> from the  
<A HREF="korganizer-4.html#sec-file">File Menu</A>.  Typically you will want to use kghostview,
ghostview, or gv here.
