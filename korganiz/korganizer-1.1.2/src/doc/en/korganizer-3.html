<H3><A NAME="s3">3. KOrganizer Docking Icon (Alarm Daemon)</A></H3>

<P>The "alarm daemon" is a small, separate program from the main
KOrganizer binary which handles all display of alarms, both visible
and audible.  It manifests itself as a small calendar icon with a bell
superimposed on top of it in the task tray area of the KDE panel.

<P>
<P>When you run KOrganizer, it checks whether or not the alarm daemon
is already running, and if it isn't, it will start it automatically.
The alarm daemon continues to run even after you exit KOrganizer,
which lets you receive alarm notification without keeping the full
KOrganizer program resident in memory at all times.  The alarm daemon
is much more light weight in it's memory requirements.
<P>
<P>The alarm daemon has several possible functions.  The main function
is to start the KOrganizer program.  A single click with the left
mouse button on the icon will launch KOrganizer.  Currently, the alarm
daemon will start a new copy of KOrganizer each time you click it;
therefore you should take care only to click it once.  This will be
fixed in the next release.
<P>
<P>The secondary alarm daemon functions are activated through a right
click on the icon, which will bring up a popup menu.  Currently, the
only choices are to enable or disable alarms, and to quit.  These
options are hopefully self-explanatory.
