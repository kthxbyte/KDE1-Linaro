 * Created 1997 by Mario Weilguni <mweilguni@sime.com>. This file 
 * is ported from Mats Luthman's <Mats.Luthman@sylog.se> JAVA applet. 
 * Many thanks to Mr. Luthman who has allowed me to put this port 
 * under the GNU GPL. Without his wonderful game engine kreversi 
 * would be just another of those Reversi programs a five year old 
 * child could beat easily. But with it it's a worthy opponent!
 *
 * If you are interested on the JAVA applet of Mr. Luthman take a
