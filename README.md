KDE1-Linaro
===========

Making KDE 1.1.2 build with gcc version 4.4.5 (Ubuntu/Linaro 4.4.4-14ubuntu5). 

Most programs included in KDE 1.1.2 build and get installed. Can't say for 
sure they actually work.

Changelog / Casualties:
=======================
- kdenetwork-1.1.2: krn has been disabled in configure script. 
Minor header/namespace hacks are not enough to get it built.
